## DESCRIPTION:
Feed a virtual pet as you earning steps!

Every day this neat watch face will randomly generate an animated pet with new colors and new shapes. The file size for this watch is very small, because everything is calculated in memory based on mathematics using your watch size , watch settings, day of the week, date, minute, and seconds data. SEE VIDEO BELOW

## INCLUDES:

>Military and Standard Time

>Full Date

>Steps

>Calories

>Heart

>Weather

>Temperature in C or F

>Notifications

>Alarms

>Battery

>Phone Connection

-- DEVELOPER NOTE --

I do not give permission to publish this identical watch to Garmin IQ Store. However, you can take a look at the code and use for learning purposes only.

To make it work, you will need the Monkey C extension, the Garmin IQ simulator downloaded, and you will need to generate your own Garmin Key and UUID.
