# Virtual-Garmin-Pet
Garmin Watch with animated pet that fits any size watch!

FULL WORKING PROGRAM for VISUAL STUDIO CODE

I do not give permission to steal the designs and publish the identical watch to Garmin IQ Store. However, you can take a look at the code and make your own version with your own font. My font is hand drawn, and I would appreciate it not being used for anything other than learning purposes. The art is generated by vectors that re-size to any watch. 

To make it work, you will need the Monkey C extension, the Garmin IQ simulator downloaded, and you will need to generate your own Garmin Key and UUID.

## DESCRIPTION:
Feed a virtual pet as you earning steps!
**Warning** Your Blobby might grow so large, that it blocks your entire screen. That is part of the fun!***

Blobby starts as a white egg, hatches, and grows. When Blobby gets big enough, it will begin its MITOSIS phase and sprout even more blobs, which will grow out of its head.

Every day this neat watch face will randomly generate an animated pet with new colors and new shapes. The file size for this watch is very small, because everything is calculated in memory based on mathematics using your watch size , watch settings, day of the week, date, minute, and seconds data. Even the spots on the blob's head are randomly generated. The system chooses between 10 colors for all designs : Black, White, Gray, Sky Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, Dark Pink, Light Pink, Green, and Light Green. Your watch maps these colors according to it's display type: AMOLED, Memory-In-Pixel (64 colors), Memory-In-Pixel (16 colors), Transflective Liquid-Crystal (High Color), and so on.

The Virtual pet has different shapes that also randomly generate a bulb head and body, including arms or no arms. They all have between 1-3 bulbs on their head that grow based on your steps. A Blobby can have 0 to 3 spots, and has a range of emotions that are also randomly generated. Blobby can quickly fill the screen on small devices and cover the text. On large devices, Blobby will fit better and the watch face is less crowded. The data is pushed to the sides to give Blobby more room to grow. See the Video Link to get a preview of what blobby might look like on your device- the video shows you the model name on the top and the memory being used on the bottom.
