## DESCRIPTION:
Feed a virtual pet as you earning steps!

Every day this neat watch face will randomly generate an animated pet with new colors and new shapes. The file size for this watch is very small, because everything is calculated in memory based on mathematics using your watch size , watch settings, day of the week, date, minute, and seconds data. The system chooses between 10 colors for all designs : Black, White, Gray, Sky Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, Dark Pink, Light Pink, Green, and Light Green. Your watch maps these colors according to it's display type: AMOLED, Memory-In-Pixel (64 colors), Memory-In-Pixel (16 colors), Transflective Liquid-Crystal (High Color), and so on. SEE VIDEO BELOW

## INCLUDES:

>Military and Standard Time

>Full Date

>Steps

>Calories

>Heart

>Weather

>Temperature in C or F

>Notifications

>Alarms

>Battery

>Phone Connection

-- DEVELOPER NOTE --

I do not give permission to publish this identical watch to Garmin IQ Store. However, you can take a look at the code and make your own version with your own font. My font is hand drawn, and I would appreciate it not being used for anything other than learning purposes. The art is generated by vectors that re-size to any watch, but please design your own to publish. 

To make it work, you will need the Monkey C extension, the Garmin IQ simulator downloaded, and you will need to generate your own Garmin Key and UUID.
